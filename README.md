# Performance-Report

**Project Overview**

The Plant Co. Quantity Performance Dashboard was developed to provide leadership with a comprehensive and interactive view of the company’s quantity performance, country-level contributions, and profitability insights for different years.
The dashboard enables data-driven decisions by consolidating sales quantity, year-over-year comparison, and account profitability into a single analytical environment.
